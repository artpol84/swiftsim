We use the multi-index notation of \cite{Dehnen2014} to simplify expressions.

\subsection{Derivatives of the gravitational potential}

The calculation of all the
$D_\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) \equiv \nabla^{\mathbf{n}}\phi(x,y,z)$ terms up
to the relevent order can be quite tedious and it is beneficial to
automatize the whole setup. Ideally, one would like to have an
expression for each of this term that is only made of multiplications
and additions of each of the coordinates and the inverse distance. We
achieve this by writing $\phi$ as a composition of functions
$\phi(u(x,y,z))$ and apply the \textit{Fa\`a di Bruno}
formula \citep[i.e. the ``chain rule'' for higher order derivatives,
e.g.][]{Hardy2006} to construct our terms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:faa_di_bruno}
\frac{\partial^n}{\partial x_1 \cdots \partial x_n} \phi(u)
= \sum_{A} \phi^{(|A|)}(u) \prod_{B \in
A} \frac{\partial^{|B|}}{\prod_{c\in B}\partial x_c} u(x,y,z),
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the set of all partitions of $\lbrace1,\cdots, n\rbrace$,
$B$ is a block of a partition $A$ and $|\cdot|$ denotes the
cardinality of a set. For generic functions $\phi$ and $u$ this
formula yields an untracktable number of terms; an 8th-order
derivative will have $4140$ (!)  terms in the sum\footnote{The number
of terms in the sum is given by the Bell number of the same order}. \\
We choose to write
\begin{align}
   \phi(x,y,z) &= 1 / \sqrt{u(x,y,z)}, \\
   u(x,y,z) &= x^2 + y^2 + z^2.
\end{align}
This choice allows to have derivatives of any order of $\phi(u)$ that
only depend on powers of $u$:

\begin{equation}
f^{(n)}(u) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2} -
n)}\frac{1}{u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}.
\end{equation}
More importantly, this choice of decomposition allows us to have
derivatives of $u$ only up to second order in $x$, $y$ or $z$. The
number of non-zero terms in eq. \ref{eq:faa_di_bruno} is hence
drastically reduced. For instance, when computing
$D_{(4,1,3)} \equiv \frac{\partial^8}{\partial x^4 \partial y \partial
z^3} \phi$, $4100$ of the $4140$ terms will involve at least one
zero-valued derivative (e.g. $\partial^3/\partial x^3$ or
$\partial^2/\partial x\partial y$) of $u$. Furthermore, among the 40
remaining terms, many will involve the same derivatives and can be
grouped together, leaving us with a sum of six products of $x$,$y$ and
$z$. This is generally the case for most of the $D_\mathbf{n}$'s and
figuring out which terms are identical in a given set of partitions of
$\lbrace1,\cdots, n\rbrace$ is an interesting exercise in
combinatorics left for the reader \citep[see also][]{Hardy2006}.
