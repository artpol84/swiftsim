Usage: swift [OPTION]... PARAMFILE
       swift_mpi [OPTION]... PARAMFILE

Valid options are:
  -a                Pin runners using processor affinity.
  -c                Run with cosmological time integration.
  -C                Run with cooling.
  -d                Dry run. Read the parameter file, allocate memory but does not read
                    the particles from ICs and exit before the start of time integration.
                    Allows user to check validy of parameter and IC files as well as memory limits.
  -D                Always drift all particles even the ones far from active particles. This emulates
                    Gadget-[23] and GIZMO's default behaviours.
  -e                Enable floating-point exceptions (debugging mode).
  -f          {int} Overwrite the CPU frequency (Hz) to be used for time measurements.
  -g                Run with an external gravitational potential.
  -G                Run with self-gravity.
  -M                Reconstruct the multipoles every time-step.
  -n          {int} Execute a fixed number of time steps. When unset use the time_end parameter to stop.
  -P  {sec:par:val} Set parameter value and overwrites values read from the parameters file. Can be used more than once.
  -s                Run with hydrodynamics.
  -S                Run with stars.
  -t          {int} The number of threads to use on each MPI rank. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
  -T                Print timers every time-step.
  -v           [12] Increase the level of verbosity:
                    1: MPI-rank 0 writes,
                    2: All MPI-ranks write.
  -y          {int} Time-step frequency at which task graphs are dumped.
  -Y          {int} Time-step frequency at which threadpool tasks are dumped.
  -h                Print this help message and exit.

See the file parameter_example.yml for an example of parameter file.
